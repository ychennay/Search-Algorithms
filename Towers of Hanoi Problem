//  The following is a way to solve the Hanoi Towers problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi). The code is from
// a Udemy course I have taken called Algorithmic Problems and Numerical Methods in Java by Holczer Balazs. I am using his derivation and elegant solution
// to create my own algorithms. 

public class Algorithm {

	public void solveHanoi(int n, char topRod, char middleRod,  char bottomRod){
		if (n == 1){
			System.out.println("Plate 1" + " moved from " + topRod + " to " + bottomRod);
			return;
		}
		
		solveHanoi(n - 1, topRod, bottomRod, middleRod);
		System.out.println("Plate " + n + " moved from " + topRod + " to " + bottomRod);
		solveHanoi(n - 1, middleRod, topRod, bottomRod);
	}
